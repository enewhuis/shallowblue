# Shallowblue

This is about as standard as a Pheonix/Ecto stack with Channels as I can imagine.  Guardian was added to secure the RESTful API and channels.

The name of the project was inspired by IBM's Deep Blue project.  That is a fairly strong hint however I'll leave it as an exercise for you to determine what my app does.  :)

This was my fist Elixir app, finally, after having been doing Erlang since before it was fashionable.  No, seriously, I think there were only a handful of us doing it in Chicago decades ago when I started on Erlang and people around me thought I was nuts.  And, yeah, I am still nuts.  ;-) 

Some time between then and now I wrote a Neuron simulator in Erlang.  I had wanted it to become a building block for developing and studying artificial brains.  Erlang's share-nothing process model seemed to map perfectly to the structure of neurons.  Some day I may integrate with this project and see where it takes me.  See https://github.com/enewhuis/neurlang if you're curious what I did and want to learn/fork/hack/laugh/etc.
