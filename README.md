# Shallowblue

This is about as standard as a Pheonix/Ecto stack with Channels as I can imagine.  Guardian was added to secure the RESTful API and channels.

The name of the project was inspired by IBM's Deep Blue project.  That is a fairly strong hint however I'll leave it as an exercise for you to determine what my app does.  :)

This was my fist Elixir app, finally, after having been doing Erlang since before it was fashionable.  No, seriously, I think there were only a handful of us in Chicago when I started on Erlang and people around me thought that I was nuts back then.  Now today, check out how cool Erlang has become!  WhatsApp sold for B!LL!0NZ to Facebook!  And, yeah, I am still nuts.  ;-)
